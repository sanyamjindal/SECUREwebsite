            <h1 class="heading">SQL INJECTION</h1>
            <p>SQL injection attacks are a common security vulnerability in web applications that allow
                attackers to execute malicious SQL commands by inserting them into user inputfields.
                These attacks can lead to unauthorized access to databases, data tampering, and
                even data destruction. <br>It is crucial for web developers to understand the principles of SQL
                injection and implement proper security measures to protect their databases. <br><br>
                Preventive measures against SQL injection attacks include properly writing SQL statements,
                filtering special characters, and using parameterized queries or preparedstatements.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">PHISHING</h1>
            <p>Phishing is a form of cyber-attack where fraudsters use fake emails, messages, or websites to
                deceive people into revealing personal information, like passwords or credit card numbers. They
                often pose as trusted entities to gain victims' trust and exploit human psychology to trick them
                into giving up sensitive data or downloading harmful software. This type of scam is widespread
                and underscores the importance of robust security measures and user vigilance in the digital age.

            <h1 class="heading">DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS)</h1>
            <p>DDoS, or Distributed Denial of Service, is a type of cyber-attack that aims to overwhelm a target
                system or network with a flood of internet traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.
                This is typically achieved by utilizing a network of compromised devices, known as a botnet, to
                generate a massive volume of traffic directed at the target, thereby disrupting its normal
                functioning. DDoS attacks can lead to severe downtime, financial losses, and reputational
                damage for the targeted organization or individual. Preventative measures and robust security
                protocols are crucial in mitigating the impact of DDoS attacks.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">CROSS SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)</h1>
            <p>XSS, or Cross-Site Scripting, is a web security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious
                scripts into web pages, enabling them to hijack user sessions, steal data, or redirect users to
                harmful sites. It often exploits unvalidated user inputs and can be prevented through strict input
                validation and output encoding practices.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">SNIFFING</h1>
            <p>Sniffing refers to the act of intercepting and monitoring data packets transmitted over a network.
                Typically employed by attackers or security professionals, sniffing allows the capture of sensitive
                information, such as usernames, passwords, or other confidential data, leading to potential
                security breaches. Sniffing can be conducted through various methods, including the use of
                specialized software or hardware, and is often carried out to gain unauthorized access to network
                traffic for malicious or surveillance purposes. Preventing and detecting sniffing activities is
                crucial to ensuring the security and privacy of network communications.</p>
